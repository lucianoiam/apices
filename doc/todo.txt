GENERAL
-------

- Wasm: states, programs and MIDI support
- Wasm: profile plugin for memory leaks
- Allow calling Window::openFileBrowser() from JavaScript
- Map alert(), confirm(), prompt() to native dialogs
- Launch system browser for HTTP links


WINDOWS
-------

- Files plugin.manifest and WebView2Loader.manifest contain a hardcoded dummy
  version for WebView2Loader.dll. It probably needs to be set to the real DLL
  version the plugin is linking against, for the cases where the host or other
  plugins try to load a different WebView2Loader.dll (not yet tested)

- As of Jun '21 Windows does not ship with the Edge runtime pre-installed. The
  plugin detects this and pops a message box, most users will figure out what
  to do but still it would be nice to present a link to the installer page.
