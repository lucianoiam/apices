GENERAL
-------

- generate-ttl.sh expects hardcoded directory bin/


LINUX
-----

- Mouse wheel events never fire
- DSSI plugin builds but UI does not open
- UI not displaying at all on Gnome Shell even running on Xorg. XEmbed related?


MACOS
-----

- Workaround with tag MACSIZEBUG https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF/issues/291
- Workaround with tag MACJACKBUG https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF/issues/298
- generate-vst-bundles.sh expects hardcoded directory bin/
- generate-vst-bundles.sh deletes all existing .vst folders, it is not safe to
  run it on a plugin basis. DPF only calls it from the main Makefile after all
  examples has been built.
- Live 10 sporadically refuses to quit from the Mac menu or by pressing Cmd+Q
  when a plugin window is open. Behavior not reproducible on REAPER.


WINDOWS
-------

- Workaround with tag WINSIZEBUG need to call UI::setSize() twice
- Workaround with tag WINJACKBUG to avoid empty window on startup
- Unresolved issue when running standalone: js->cpp messages get stuck unless
  window is resized. There is something definitely wrong with the event loop
  when running as a standalone application, probably related to WINJACKBUG.
