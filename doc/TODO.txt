WINDOWS
-------

- Find out if it is possible to get the WebView2 SDK files without Visual Studio
  and update build docs

- Files plugin.manifest and WebView2Loader.manifest contain a hardcoded dummy
  version of WebView2Loader.dll. It probably needs to be set to the real DLL
  version the plugin is linking against, for the cases where the host or other
  plugins try to load a different WebView2Loader.dll (not yet tested)
