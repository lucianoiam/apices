GENERAL
-------

- Allow calling Window::openFileBrowser() from JavaScript
- Map alert(), confirm(), prompt() to native dialogs
- Launch system browser for HTTP links

New features should strictly relate to controlling the plugin or adding any
missing UI tool that makes sense in an audio plugin context, bridging DPF C++
code first when available.


LINUX
-----

- DSSI plugin currently builds but fails to start. It is disabled anyways, as
  the format is not compatible with DISTRHO_PLUGIN_WANT_FULL_STATE.

- UI not displaying at all on Gnome Shell even running on Xorg. XEmbed related?

- platform::getBinaryPath() uses a cheap hack to check whether the program runs
  standalone or loaded from library during runtime. Implementation works but is
  a bit ashaming and should be replaced with a guaranteed, documented method.


WINDOWS
-------

- Standalone window appears empty on startup until clicking the window border

- Files plugin.manifest and WebView2Loader.manifest contain a hardcoded dummy
  version for WebView2Loader.dll. It probably needs to be set to the real DLL
  version the plugin is linking against, for the cases where the host or other
  plugins try to load a different WebView2Loader.dll (not yet tested)

- As of Jun '21 Windows does not ship with the Edge runtime pre-installed. The
  plugin detects this and pops a message box, most users will figure out what
  to do but still it would be nice to present a link to the installer page.
