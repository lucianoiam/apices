GENERAL
-------

- Allow calling Window::openFileBrowser() from JavaScript

- Map alert(), confirm(), prompt() to native dialogs

- Launch system browser for HTTP links


LINUX
-----

- DSSI plugin currently builds but fails to start

- UI not displaying at all on Gnome Shell even running on Xorg. XEmbed related?

- platform::getBinaryPath() uses a cheap hack to check whether the program runs
  standalone or loaded from library during runtime. Implementation works but is
  a bit ashaming and should be replaced with a guaranteed, documented method.


MACOS
-----

- Cmd+Q for quitting host does not work when plugin window is open and focused,
  regardless the keyboard forward feature is enabled or not. Affects Live 10,
  not reproducible on REAPER.

- Live 10 sometimes refuses to quit from the Mac menu when a plugin window is
  open. Behavior not reproducible on REAPER. Probably related to previous issue.


WINDOWS
-------

- Standalone window appears empty on startup until clicking the window border

- Files plugin.manifest and WebView2Loader.manifest contain a hardcoded dummy
  version for WebView2Loader.dll. It probably needs to be set to the real DLL
  version the plugin is linking against, for the cases where the host or other
  plugins try to load a different WebView2Loader.dll (not yet tested)

- As of Jun '21 Windows does not ship with the Edge runtime pre-installed. The
  plugin detects this and pops a message box, most users will figure out what
  to do but still it would be nice to present a link to the installer page.
