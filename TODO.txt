GENERAL
-------

- Make web UI support optional
- generate-vst-bundles.sh and generate-ttl.sh expect hardcoded directory bin/
- generate-vst-bundles.sh deletes all existing .vst folders, it is not safe to
  call on a plugin basis. DPF only calls it from the main Makefile after all
  examples has been built.
- Allow calling Window::openFileBrowser() from JavaScript
- Map alert(), confirm(), prompt() to native dialogs
- Launch system browser for HTTP links


LINUX
-----

- DSSI plugin builds but UI does not open
- UI not displaying at all on Gnome Shell even running on Xorg. XEmbed related?


MACOS
-----

- Patch for https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF/issues/291 with tag MACSIZEBUG
- Workaround for https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF/issues/298 with tag MACJACKBUG
- Live 10 sporadically refuses to quit from the Mac menu or by pressing Cmd+Q
  when a plugin window is open. Behavior not reproducible on REAPER.


WINDOWS
-------

- Workaround with tag WINSIZEBUG
- Files plugin.manifest and WebView2Loader.manifest contain a hardcoded dummy
  version for WebView2Loader.dll. It probably needs to be set to the real DLL
  version the plugin is linking against, for the cases where the host or other
  plugins try to load a different WebView2Loader.dll (not yet tested)

- As of Jun '21 Windows does not ship with the Edge runtime pre-installed. The
  plugin detects this and pops a message box, most users will figure out what
  to do but still it would be nice to present a link to the installer page.
