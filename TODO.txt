GENERAL
-------

- Allow calling Window::openFileBrowser() from JavaScript

- Map alert(), confirm(), prompt() to native dialogs

- Launch system browser for HTTP links


LINUX
-----

- DSSI plugin builds but UI does not open

- UI not displaying at all on Gnome Shell even running on Xorg. XEmbed related?


MACOS
-----

- Finish fixing keyboard input on REAPER

- There is a patch to workaround bug https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF/issues/291

- Live 10 sporadically refuses to quit from the Mac menu or by pressing Cmd+Q
  when a plugin window is open. Behavior not reproducible on REAPER.


WINDOWS
-------

- LV2 plugin builds but UI does not open

- There is an issue with some DGL calls marked in code with tag WINSIZEBUG.

- Standalone version build fails for latest DPF develop but works for e28b677,
  temporarily disable JACK target.

- Standalone window appears empty on startup until clicking the window border

- Files plugin.manifest and WebView2Loader.manifest contain a hardcoded dummy
  version for WebView2Loader.dll. It probably needs to be set to the real DLL
  version the plugin is linking against, for the cases where the host or other
  plugins try to load a different WebView2Loader.dll (not yet tested)

- As of Jun '21 Windows does not ship with the Edge runtime pre-installed. The
  plugin detects this and pops a message box, most users will figure out what
  to do but still it would be nice to present a link to the installer page.
