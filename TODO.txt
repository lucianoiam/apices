GENERAL
-------

- Allow calling Window::openFileBrowser() from JavaScript

- Map alert(), confirm(), prompt() to native dialogs

- Launch system browser for HTTP links


LINUX
-----

- DSSI plugin currently builds but fails to start

- UI not displaying at all on Gnome Shell even running on Xorg. XEmbed related?

- platform::getBinaryPath() uses a cheap hack to check whether the program runs
  standalone or loaded from library during runtime. Implementation works but is
  a bit ashaming and should be replaced with a guaranteed, documented method.


WINDOWS
-------

- Find out if it is possible to get the WebView2 SDK files without Visual Studio
  and update build docs

- Files plugin.manifest and WebView2Loader.manifest contain a hardcoded dummy
  version for WebView2Loader.dll. It probably needs to be set to the real DLL
  version the plugin is linking against, for the cases where the host or other
  plugins try to load a different WebView2Loader.dll (not yet tested)

- As of Jun '21 Windows does not ship with the Edge runtime pre-installed. The
  plugin detects this and pops a message box, most users will figure out what
  to do but still it would be nice to present a link to the installer page.

- LV2 is currently broken, binary builds but TTL creation fails
