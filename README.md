[WIP] Multiplatform VST audio plugins with HTML/JavaScript UI
-------------------------------------------------------------

What if the UI toolkit was a web UI toolkit? :)

* Based on DPF: DISTRHO Plugin Framework
* C++ for DSP code
* HTML/CSS/JS for UI code
* Linux, macOS and Windows
* VST2, LV2, DSSI and JACK-based standalone app
* Makefile based
* Lightweight
* BSD-like license

This is work in progress ( nearly 70% complete )

**"DPF is designed to make development of new plugins an easy and enjoyable task"**
