Hip-Hap / High Performance Hybrid Audio Plugins
-----------------------------------------------

This project extends [DPF](http://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF) to provide the
necessary scaffold for creating audio plugins with potentially complex user
interfaces. Plugins implement a web view for running the UI, which interacts
with the audio host through a small factory shipped JavaScript class. The DSP
core remains isolated and implemented in C++ or AssemblyScript.

### Features

* Based on DISTRHO Plugin Framework
* C++ or AssemblyScript for DSP code
* HTML / CSS / JS for UI development
* VST2 / LV2 plugin formats
* Linux / Mac / Windows
* Just the powerful basics
* BSD-like license

__Support for AssemblyScript is still work in progress.__ [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org)
is a language very similar to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
specifically created for targeting [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org).
Plugins written with Hip-Hap embed a WebAssembly JIT engine for running
precompiled AssemblyScript-based DSP code. This engine is completely independent
from the web view.

The following DSP / UI language combinations are available:

DSP|UI |Comments
---|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++|JS |Web view user interface
AS |JS |Web view user interface
AS |C++|Widgets provided by DISTRHO Graphics Library (DGL)
C++|C++|Do not use this project, check [DPF](http://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF) instead

### Example UI code

```JavaScript
class MyPluginUI extends DISTRHO_UI {

    constructor() {
    	super();
    
        // Connect <input type="range" id="gain"> element to a parameter

        document.getElementById('gain').addEventListener('input', (ev) => {
            this.setParameterValue(0, parseFloat(ev.target.value));
        });

        this.flushInitMessageQueue();
    }

    parameterChanged(index, value) {
        // Host informs a parameter change, update input element value

        switch (index) {
            case 0:
                document.getElementById('gain').value = value;
                break;
        }
    }
    
}
```

**Usage of JS frameworks is up to the developer**

### About DISTRHO Plugin Framework (DPF)

The framework sports an accurate motto: "DPF is designed to make development of
new plugins an easy and enjoyable task". It is a low footprint yet powerful tool
that allows developers to focus on productivity by already solving many not
trivial issues commonly found in the audio plugins domain.

What makes it great?

- It comes with a clear permissive license
- Bloat-free: scope is limited to audio plugins
- Makefile based, MinGW compatible
- Extremely low learning curve
- High quality clean C++ codebase
- Great experienced community around

Its full documentation and code can be found at https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF,
this repo includes it as a git submodule in `dpf`.  There are lots of other cool
audio projects worth checking at https://github.com/DISTRHO.
