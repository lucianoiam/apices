GENERAL BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------

1. DPF is linked as a git submodule. Make sure it was cloned to lib/dpf and
   the selected branch is develop.

2. make


LINUX ONLY
----------

1. There is a hardcoded path in GtkWebView.cpp, const char* fixmeHardcodedPath


WINDOWS ONLY
------------

Native binaries for Windows can be built by cross-compiling on Linux or by
installing the MinGW toolchain on Windows:

1. Download MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/ then follow website instructions
   to install the mingw-64 GCC

2. Install WebView2 SDK from Microsoft, this can be done using their free IDE
   Visual Studio Community:

   - Create Project
   - Right click on solution
   - Manage NuGet packages
   - Find and install Microsoft.Web.WebView2
   - Copy < SOLUTION_DIR >/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2.< VERSION > to
     < PLUGIN_DIR >/lib/WebView2 , note the version suffix needs to be stripped.

   SDK documentation at
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/gettingstarted/win32

   TODO:
   - Does the SDK license already allow to redistribute DLLs?
   - Is there a way to get the files without installing Visual Studio?

3. For now WebView2Loader.dll must be copied to the host's .exe directory or
   C:\Windows\system32 as there is no rpath equivalent on Windows. A possible
   solution is to set search path during runtime (WIP)
