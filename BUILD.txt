GENERAL BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------

1. DPF is linked as a git submodule. Make sure it was cloned to lib/dpf and
   the selected branch is develop.

2. make


MACOS ONLY
----------

1. The generated VST plugin extension is .dylib, it needs to be changed to .vst
   otherwise REAPER will not find it. Is this true for any host?


LINUX ONLY
----------

1. There is a hardcoded path in WebUI.cpp: const char* fixmeHardcodedPath = ...


WINDOWS ONLY
------------

Native binaries for Windows can be built by cross-compiling on Linux or by
installing the MinGW toolchain on Windows:

1. Download MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/ then follow website instructions
   to install the mingw-64 GCC

2. Install WebView2 SDK from Microsoft, this can be done using their free IDE
   Visual Studio Community:

   - Create Project
   - Right click on solution
   - Manage NuGet packages
   - Find and install Microsoft.Web.WebView2
   - Copy < solution dir >/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2.< version > to
     < plugin dir >/lib/WebView2

   SDK documentation at
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/gettingstarted/win32

   TODO:
   - Does the SDK license already allow to redistribute DLLs?
   - Is there a way to get the files without installing Visual Studio?

3. For now WebView2Loader.dll must be copied to the host's .exe directory or
   C:\Windows\system32 as there is no rpath equivalent on Windows. A possible
   solution is to set search path during runtime (WIP)
