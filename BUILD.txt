BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

1. DPF is linked as a git submodule. Make sure it was cloned to lib/dpf and
   the selected branch is develop.

2. make


NOTES FOR WINDOWS
-----------------

1. For running the plugin the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime must be installed
   on the host machine https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2

2. Native binaries can be built by cross-compiling on Linux or by installing the
   MinGW toolchain on Windows. Download MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/ then
   follow website instructions to install the mingw-64 GCC. Once done run make.

3. For building the Edge WebView2 SDK is required. It is available with name
   Microsoft.Web.WebView2 at the NuGet package repository. NuGet tool ships with
   Visual Studio and it is also available as a single file download:

   wget -P /usr/bin https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe

   When cross-compiling it is also possible to install NuGet on Linux following
   instructions here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools
   Ubuntu repositories already offer a nuget package, check your distro repos.

   Once NuGet is installed:

   nuget install Microsoft.Web.WebView2 -OutputDirectory lib/windows
   ln -rs lib/windows/Microsoft.Web.WebView2.* lib/windows/Microsoft.Web.WebView2

   Note that the default behavior of ln -s on MinGW is to copy files rather than
   symlinking. Enabling symlinks on MinGW is possible but then requires to run
   bash as administrator and setting an environment variable:

   export MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict

   It is probably easier to just rename the downloaded directory :)

   If nuget.exe fails due to a TLS error on Windows 7 follow the instructions
   here: https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8176

   How to get SDK using Visual Studio or the free Visual Studio Community IDE:

   - Create Project
   - Right click on solution
   - Manage NuGet packages
   - Find and install Microsoft.Web.WebView2
   - Copy < SOLUTION_DIR >/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2.< VERSION > to
     < PLUGIN_DIR >/lib/windows/Microsoft.Web.WebView2
