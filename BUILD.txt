GENERAL BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------

1. DPF is linked as a git submodule. Make sure it was cloned to lib/dpf and
   the selected branch is develop.

2. make



LINUX ONLY
----------

DSSI plugin currently builds but fails to start



WINDOWS ONLY
------------

Native binaries for Windows can be built by cross-compiling on Linux or by
installing the MinGW toolchain on Windows:

1. Download MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/ then follow website instructions
   to install the mingw-64 GCC

2. Install WebView2 SDK from Microsoft, this can be done using their free IDE
   Visual Studio Community:

   - Create Project
   - Right click on solution
   - Manage NuGet packages
   - Find and install Microsoft.Web.WebView2
   - Copy < SOLUTION_DIR >/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2.< VERSION > to
     < PLUGIN_DIR >/lib/WebView2 , note the version suffix needs to be stripped.

   SDK documentation at
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/gettingstarted/win32

   TODO:
   - Does the SDK license already allow to redistribute DLLs?
   - Is there a way to get the files without installing Visual Studio?

3. For testing and distribution

   - Download and install the Microsoft Edge Webview2 Runtime
     https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2

   - Plugin links to WebView2Loader.dll. Since there is no rpath equivalent on
     Windows, the plugin DLL path is added to the libraries search path during
     runtime at DllMain(). This hack works for Carla but it is currently failing
     on REAPER. To avoid the missing library issue, WebView2Loader.dll can be
     placed alongside the host .exe or copied to C:\Windows\system32

4. LV2 is currently broken, binary builds but TTL creation fails
